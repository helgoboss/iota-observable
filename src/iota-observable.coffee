class Observable
  ###
  An object which notifies observers whenever a property is changed using `set`.
  ###
  
  @SetOperationFailed: class extends Error
    ###
    Error thrown if a property value could not be set.
    ###
    constructor: (obj, key, value) ->
      @message = "Setting [#{key}] to [#{value}] on [#{obj}] failed"
  
  @makeObservable: (obj) ->
    ###
    Makes the given object `obj` observable by copying all `Observable` methods to it and initializing the `Observable`'s state.
    ###
    # Copy Observable's prototype properties to the object
    for key, value of @::
      obj[key] = value
      
    # Initialize object
    obj._init()
  
  constructor: (obj) ->
    ###
    Initializes the Observable. If `obj` is given, all its properties are copied into the new `Observable`.
    ###
    # Initialize
    @_init()
    
    # Copy properties of obj
    if obj?
      for key, value of obj
        @[key] = value

  set: (args...) ->
    ###
    Sets the values of one or several properties of this object or nested objects and informs observers.
    
    If a single argument is passed, it is assumed to be an object containing keypath-value pairs. If two arguments 
    are passed, the first one is interpreted as the keypath and the second one as the value.
    
    The property is identified by its keypath using the dot notation. The implementation follows the keypath 
    and sets the referenced property to the given value. If it meets a dead end on the path (an object which 
    doesn't contain the property which comes next on the keypath), it just creates an empty object and continues 
    with the rest of the keypath. If it cannot set the value because it stumbles upon a defined property whose type is 
    not an object, it throws an `Observable.SetOperationFailed` error.
    
    Returns the old value or `undefined` if there was none. If multiple properties are set, returns and array of old values.

    batchStarted = @beginBatch()
    
    oldValue = if args.length == 1
      # A map containing new keypath-value pairs has been given

  get: (keypath) ->
    ### 
    Returns the property identified by the given keypath.
    
    Also handles computed properties by evaluating them. If other properties are queried using `get` during the evaluation of the
    computed property, their dependencies are tracked.

      # That means, the computation of property c uses property d. We can also say, the computed
      # property c depends on d. So later, whenever we set d, we also need to inform the observers of d
      # because it most likely changed as well.
      
      # Build up a relation "when property 'keypath' (computed or not) changed, also inform computed property 'dependentKeypath'"
      # We could do this also using the already available observer mechanism: @on keypath, => @invalidate(dependentKeypath)
      # But then we don't have the option to separate the (kind of implicit) computed property observer calls from the rest.

    ###
    Manually informs the observers about a change in the property with the given keypath. This is for example necessary
    when dealing with changes in array properties.
    
    Delays the notification if a batch is active until `endBatch` is called.

    ###
    Starts a batch. 
    
    Within a batch, observers are not notified of changes. They will be notified as soon as `endBatch` is called.
    
    If a batch was already active, the method has no effect and returns false.

    Ends the batch and carries out the delayed observer notifications.
    
    If no batch was active, the method has no effect and returns false.
